There are some words that simply don't sound comfy. I'm talking about those words that make you feel like you stepped on a wet spot on the kitchen floor in your favorite argile socks.

These words couldn't care less what plans you had, they are more concerned with what havoc they can wreak on society. Take a gander below:
### _Moist_
This is an understatement regarding your favorite argyle socks.

### _Bologna_
While some folks may enjoy this mystery meat, many despise it for it's spongey quality and overall terrible name. Italy rarely does wrong, but they messed up this time

### _Slit_
This word is so sharp it could bisect a sheet of loose leaf paper. Don't ever use it unless you are in a dire situation.

### _Squeamish_
This word makes me shrivel. I imagine spoiled milk that has curdled and gone off the deep end.

### _Licorice_
The English language is pretty wild, not sure how this spelling can result in a pronunciation "lick-o-rush", but when you think of it like that, it makes me wonder what I am in such a rush to lick... certainly not black licorice.

### _Excrete_
Not only is this word a chore to pronounce, but it also makes me think of things that ooze undesirably. No thanks.

### _Sausage_
 Makes me think of this....

...enough said.


### _Creamy_
 Somewhere in between wet and soft lies creamy and that's just not great.

### Ointment
 You may be noticing a theme. 

### Belch


... more to come.
