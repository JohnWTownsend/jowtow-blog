There are some words that simply don't sound comfy. I'm talking about those words that make you feel like you stepped on a wet spot on the kitchen floor in your favorite argile socks.

These words couldn't care less what plans you had, they are more concerned with what havic they can wreak on society. Take a gander below:
- Moist: this is an understatement regarding your favorite argile socks.
- Bologna: while some folks may enjoy this mystery meat, many despise it for it's spongey quality and overall terrible name. Italy rarely does wrong, but they messed up this time
- Slit: this word is so sharp it could bisect a sheet of loose leaf paper. Don't ever use it unless you are in a dire situation.
