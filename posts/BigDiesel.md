If you were curious enough to navigate to this blog post, you're probably wondering "What is Big Diesel?". If that is in fact what you are wondering, you have come to the right place. Big Diesel is none other than my loyal compatriot, trusty steed, and ride of choice over asphalt pastures. That's right, Big Diesel is my vehicle, and I'll be spittin' if it's not the best vehicle this side of the Mississippi. Allow me to explain myself.

Big Diesel and I met in the fall of 2018. She was the successor to my once beloved Dora. Dora (the 2003 Ford Explorer) had been a wonderous vehicle, but her time had come. Ever since the day I acquired this vehicle, I've been very happy with my choice.

Big Diesel is a 2012 Volkswagen Sportwagen TDI. She makes 140 Horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque with an inline 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. Her drink of choice is pure diesel fuel and on a good day, she'll make 40 MPG. I have hauled many large items with the help of Big Diesel including a full sized dresser and even a reclining chair. 

Another reason to love my car is that it uses synthetic oil. It's a little more expensive each time I go and get the oil changed, but I only have to go every 8-10k miles which is super nice. 

Did I mention that Big Diesel is quick? This practical vehicle has got plenty of get-up-n-go thanks to the turbsky up front. VW's TDI engines are known to last a long time. I bought Big Diesel at 52k miles and am near around 100k miles now. I wouldn't be surprised if I drive it another couple 100k.
